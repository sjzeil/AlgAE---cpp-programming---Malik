# Animations for C++ Programming - Malik

This is a collection of algorithm animations for a C++ Programmign II course
(developed for the web course offering of CS333 from Old Dominion University, Norfolk Virginia).

Most of the animated code is taken from Malik,  C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design, 6e,
2012, 978-1133626381, Cengage Learning


The animations are developed using the [AlgAE animation engine](https://github.com/sjzeil/AlgAE). AlgAE is 
currently distributed in source form only, so to prepare these demos, you will need to install and build AlgAE
first.
